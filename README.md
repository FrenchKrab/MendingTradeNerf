# MendingTradeNerf

Pretty simple : nerfs mending trades, by making the emerald cost constant and adding curses (binding/vanishing) to the book. These nerfs are configurable.

This is more or less just a open-sourced & more configurable version of [BinsNerf](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/binsnerf.77430/).

## Commands

`/mtnreload` : reload / regenerate the config file

## Default config

```yaml
# How many emeralds the trade costs (constant)
cost: 64

# Add Curse of Vanishing to villager-traded mending books ?
vanishing: true

# Add Curse of Binding to villager-traded mending books ?
binding: true
```
